# Computer-Vision-Tool

When working on Image processing and Computer Vision algorithms, I constantly use to experiment with many preliminary image processing operations such as edge detection, blur etc. To make my experimentation easy, I decided to build an GUI application. 

Currently this application supports following functionalities

### Edge Detections
  - Sobel
  - Canny

### Blur
  - Homogeneous
  - Median
  - Gaussian
  - Bilateral
