# Computer-Vision-Tool for Windows

When working on Image processing and Computer Vision algorithms, I constantly use to experiment with many preliminary image processing operations such as edge detection, blur etc. To make my experimentation easy, I decided to build an QT based GUI application. 

Currently this application supports following functionalities from OpenCV

### Edge Detection
  - Sobel
  - Canny

### Blur
  - Homogeneous
  - Median
  - Gaussian
  - Bilateral
  
##Installation
Download the executable and install and run the ImageProcessingApp.exe

##How to use
Please check out the demo [video](https://nrupatunga-gmail.tinytake.com/sf/NzUyNTg4XzM0NDE0OTM)
